## Audio visualiser


To turn the sound into something that can be visualised p5.js provides
a Fast Fourier Transform object. Take a look at its description in the
[p5.sound documentation](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5.FFT).


- `FFT.analyze()` returns an array of 1024 values between 0
  and 255. Each value represents the amplitude (loudness) of a small
  frequency range (pitch of the sound).

- `FFT.waveform()` returns an array of 1024 values between -1
  and 1. Each value represents the amplitude of the sound for a tiny
  portion of time.

- `FFT.energy(freq1, [freq2])` returns the volume of the sound at
  frequency range specified by the `freq1` and `freq2` parameter. You
  can specify `freq1` as a number or p5.js provides strings for common
  values such as “bass” and “treble”, and leave `freq2` empty.
